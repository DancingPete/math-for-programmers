# Text Notes - Math for Programmers by Paul Orland

This site is a set of notes representing the study of Paul Orland's *Math for Programmers*.

Within the source code of the project are both the sample code provided by the author
and publisher, as well as the implementation of the exercises by myself.

Help yourself, and feel free to pay me a compliment.
I can use them in these domains, which remain areas of wretched and remediable
inadequacy.

## Part 1 - Vectors and Graphics

In this first part of the book, we dig into the branch of math called linear algebra. (19)

> **Linear algebra**: The branch of mathematics dealing with computations on multi-dimensional data. (19)

The most basic concept in linear algebra is the *vector*. (19)

> **Vector**: Data point in some multi-dimensional space (19)

Another key concept is that of a linear transformation. (19)

> **Linear transformation**: Function type that takes a vector as input and returns a vector
as output while preserving the 'geometry' of the vectors involved (19)

> **Matrices**: Rectangular arrays of numbers that can represent linear transformations (19)
